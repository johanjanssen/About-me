# [Java Upgrades](https://github.com/johanjanssen/JavaUpgrades))
Created and maintained documentation and code examples to help upgrading applications from Java 8 to newer versions such as 11, 17 and 21. This was used as the basis for a talk I regularly presented and articles for the Oracle Java Magazine and InfoQ.

# [Java Hidden Gems](https://github.com/johanjanssen/JavaHiddenGems)
Created a repository of 60+ interesting tools and libraries with many examples. Used as the basis for a talk I regularly presented to teach developers about tools and libraries they didn't knew.

# Chocolatey packages
Created and maintained 100+ Chocolatey Packages from 2018 until the end of 2023 to install OpenJDK, Adoptium Temurin, GraalVM, Microsoft OpenJDK, Bellsoft Liberica, Amazon Corretto, WildFly, SapMachine, Maven Daemon, ojdkbuild and AdoptOpenJDK on Windows. Monthly downloads increased over time and reached more than one hundred thousand downloads a month for quite some time and more than five million downloads in total.

# [Java Continuous Delivery Pipeline](https://github.com/johanjanssen/JavaContinuousDeliveryPipeline)
*No longer maintained* The project was used in presentation to show how relatively easy it was to setup a continuous delivery pipeline with Docker, Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Gitlab, Gatling, OWASP Dependency Check and PiTest (mutation testing)

# [Sensors to InfluxDB](https://github.com/johanjanssen/SensorsToInfluxDB)
*No longer maintained* Used to demonstrate how InfluxDB, a time series database, can be used to store sensordata from sensors such as the BME280, Xiaomi and Raspberry Pi in an easy way and then visualize it.

# [Alexa examples 1](https://github.com/johanjanssen/Alexa-ASK-SDK-Examples) and [Alexa examples 2](https://github.com/johanjanssen/AlexaExamples)
*No longer maintained* Used to demonstrate skills for Alexa, used both on a regular Amazon Alexa and for a Raspberry Pi running the Alexa software. 

# [Akka examples](https://github.com/johanjanssen/Akka-examples)
*No longer maintained* Used in combination with a cluster of Raspberry Pi's to demonstrate the various Akka features and demonstrate scenario's such as failover in case a Raspberry Pi was shutdown.

# [Lego infrared support](https://github.com/johanjanssen/LCCInstallScript)
*No longer maintained* Some scripts used to communicate with Lego infrared devices and Raspberry Pi camera's. This was used with Raspberry Pi's and an application to control the speed, sounds (with a speaker) of Lego trains and the direction of track switches with servos.

# [Lego infrared Spring Boot example](https://github.com/johanjanssen/LCC)
*No longer maintained* Simple Spring Boot application which can be used to control any Lego set which has the older infrared system such as trains and Lego technic sets.
