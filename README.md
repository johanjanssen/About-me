# About me
I like sharing my knowledge and try to help others, some things I've done in the past are listed in these pages. If you want me to give a presentation, help with a conference, write an article or anything else, please contact me via 
for instance [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johanjanssen42) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johanjanssen2001/).

During the years I presented more than 90 session at conferences in 24 countries. Earning JavaOne Rock Star and Oracle Code One Star awards (for the top rated speakers by the audiene) along the road. Many more presentations were given at Universities, companies, Java User Groups (JUG) and Meetups.

After speaking at quite some conferences I couldn't resist organizing one myself: JVMCON. I invented the concept and organized the conference. Attendees who bought a ticket rated the talks that were submitted in the call for papers. During that process they couldn't see the presenter's information, the rating was purely on content. The top-rated talks were selected. Next to that we invited some well known speakers such as Venkat Subramaniam and Hadi Hariri. The conference was sold out and highly rated by the more than 300 attendees.

Except from speaking I regularly write articles, mainly for InfoQ nowadays and was a member of the Dutch Java Magazine editorial board.
