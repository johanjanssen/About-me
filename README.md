# About me
I like sharing my knowledge and try to help others, some things I've done in the past are listed in these pages. If you want me to give a presentation, help with a conference, write an article or anything else, please contact me via 
for instance [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johanjanssen42) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johanjanssen2001/).

During the years I presented more than 60 session at more than 40 different conferences in 20 countries. Earning JavaOne Rock Star and Oracle Code One Star awards (for the top rated speakers by the audiene) along the road. Many more presentations were given at Universities, companies, Java User Groups (JUG) and Meetups.

After speaking at quite some conferences I couldn't resist organizing one myself: JVMCON. I invented the concept and organized the conference. Attendees who bought a ticket rated the talks that were submitted in the call for papers. During that process they couldn't see the presenter's information, the rating was purely on content. The top-rated talks were selected. Next to that we invited some well known speakers such as Venkat Subramaniam and Hadi Hariri. The conference was sold out and highly rated by the more than 300 attendees.

Except from speaking I regularly write articles and was a member of the Dutch Java Magazine editorial board.

More detailed information can be found via the links below.

[GitHub](https://github.com/johanjanssen) contains some sample projects and items I used in presentations. It also contains configuration for the Chocolatey packages I maintain.

[Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/profiles/JohanJanssen) is a Windows package manager. I created and maintain packages for JDK's and JRE's of OpenJDK, AdoptOpenJDK, Liberica JDK, AWS Corretto, Microsoft's OpenJDK build and ojdkbuild. But also for other Java software such as GraalVM, JBoss WildFly and the Maven Daemon. Currently, they're downloaded more than one hundred thousand times a month.

Please contact me if you'd like me to give the presentation described below at your conference, organization, company, Meetup, JUG or where ever.

Title: Upgrade to Java 16 or 17
Alternative title: How and Why to Upgrade to Java 16 or 17

Summary:
Java upgrades are sometimes seen as difficult, and many applications are still running on an older version of Java. This session describes Java’s current six months release process and why applications should use a recent Java version.

After that, I’ll explain the challenges of upgrading and provide some useful tips to make the process easier. Concrete examples (including solutions) will be used to show you how to upgrade your application to Java 16 or 17.

Extra info:
- Currently, I only present online.
- This talk is based on the examples and documentation I created on [GitHub](https://github.com/johanjanssen/JavaUpgrades).
- Duration can be anything between 25 and 60 minutes. Questions/discussions are more than welcome.
- The goal is to help projects migrate from older versions such as Java 8 or even older to Java 17.
