- Invented the concept and organized the conference. Attendees who bought a ticket rated the talks that were submitted in the call for papers. During that process they couldn't see the presenter's information, the rating was purely on content. The top rated talks were selected. Next to that we invited some well known speakers such as Venkat Subramaniam and Hadi Hariri. The conference was sold out and highly rated by the more than 300 attendees.
